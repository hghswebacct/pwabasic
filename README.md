# School Timetable PWA

This project is a simple Progressive Web App (PWA) that displays a weekly school timetable. It serves as the first example in a series of tutorials designed to teach the basics of creating PWAs.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Offline Support**: The app works offline once added to the home screen, leveraging PWA capabilities.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean layout displaying subjects and periods for each day of the week.
- **Installable**: Can be installed as a standalone app on mobile and desktop devices.

## How to Access

The app is hosted at: [School Timetable PWA](https://mrhoran8120.github.io/pwabasic/)

## How It Works

1. **Manifest File**: Includes metadata for the app, such as its name, icons, and start URL, enabling installation on devices.
2. **Service Worker**: Caches resources for offline use, ensuring the app remains functional without an internet connection.
3. **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core technologies used to build the app.

## Educational Purpose

This project is part of a course that teaches how to create Progressive Web Apps. It introduces students to the fundamentals of PWAs, including:

- Setting up a basic PWA structure.
- Adding a manifest file and service worker.
- Hosting a PWA on GitHub Pages.

## Installation Instructions

1. Open the app link in a web browser: [School Timetable PWA](https://mrhoran8120.github.io/pwabasic/).
2. On mobile devices, tap the **Add to Home Screen** option to install.
3. On desktop, use the browser's **Install App** feature.

## Future Enhancements

This app is part of a series, and future examples will include:
- Dynamic data loading.
